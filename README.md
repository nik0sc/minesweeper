# NOTICE TO CURRENT AND FUTURE STUDENTS OF CS171 AT UCI
Apparently this repository is on the first page of Google search results for `uci cs171` and loads of people are looking at this repo every day. Somebody even forked it last month. While I am honoured, I would like to take this opportunity to address you, the reader. I am not a UCI student although I did spend a summer there in 2018.

I understand that the current CS171 project has changed quite a bit, to the extent that it no longer involves the game Minesweeper. I do not know if this code is still applicable for any current or future CS171 class project.

I affirm that all code committed in and after the commit [d087053](https://github.com/nik0sc/minesweeper/commit/d08705337672746626467f3c6f251f9d66e9b857) is mine and mine only. I also affirm that all code before that commit (the starter code) is **NOT** written by me and copyright belongs to their original authors.

This code is **NOT** MIT-licensed because it is not clear what the initial license terms for the starter code were. Basing your own class project off this code would also count as plagiarism, which is Very Bad.

Bearing all that in mind, you are free to peruse this code at your own risk. The code is released as-is with all faults and no guarantee of correctness. You may **NOT** alter or redistribute this code for your own purposes, and certainly not for submission as your own work.

I do not know if the last paragraph I have written is legally binding or enforceable in court. I am not a lawyer but I hope this covers my back.

To Prof. Lathrop or any other member of the CS171 teaching team: please feel free to open an issue if you would like to discuss anything about this repository.
